        I want to relive when I make.<br /><br />
        And photographs come closest in telling you what it’s like to miss my
        family in Belarus<br /><br />
        and<br /><br />
        what it’s like construct my own story within the familial narrative;<br /><br />
        what it’s like to put together a home so far away but filled with
        familiar symbols;<br /><br />
        what it’s like to console my dear ones in the face of a war;<br /><br />
        what it’s like to hold a warm quail egg,<br /><br />
        or look at my brother’s sweaty hair behind his ear,<br /><br />
        or to trace the wrinkles on my grandmother’s face,<br /><br />
        or to trace the wrinkles on a friend’s face;<br /><br />
        or<br /><br />
        what it’s like to find the people that feel like a new family for a
        moment or for many.<br /><br />
